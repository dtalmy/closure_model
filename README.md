source code and configuration files for Darwin-MITgcm

Enclosed here are the necessary files to reproduce results in our main paper, that need to be combined with the base Darwin-MITgcm code that is available elsewhere (https://gitlab.com/darwinproject/gud). Building and execution are dependent upon architecture used to run the code, and we refer to the Darwin-MITgcm documentation (https://darwin3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/overview.html) for guidance.

/code - source code containing necessary modifications to the base Darwin-MITgcm model. Files can be added to the code directory of the above-mentioned Darwin-MITgcm 

/input - configuration files, can be added to the input directory within a given MITgcm verification 

/scripts - scripts for compiling, running, and post-processing.
